## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me several tasks to perform an audit of a recent local congressional election. The tasks are as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes for each county.
3. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
4. Determine who the candidates were and then provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election, provide what their vote count was and their percentage of the total votes.
